Acornsoft Elite (Econet version)

Econet conversion by Mark Moxon

For the following networked machines:

* BBC Micro with 6502 Second Processor
* BBC Master 128
* BBC Master Turbo

To install Elite on your network:

1. Create a directory called $.Elite on
the server and copy all the ELT* files
and this README file into the directory

2. Either copy EliteM and EliteSP into
$.Library and $.Library1 (if you want
all users to be able to play Elite)

Or copy EliteM and EliteSP into each
user's main directory (if you want
to restrict it to those users only)

3. Create a directory called Elite in
the top level of each user's main
directory, and copy the MAX file there

4. Users can then play Elite by typing:

*EliteM  (for BBC Master 128 Elite)

*EliteSP (for 6502 Second Proc Elite)

If you copied EliteM and EliteSP into
the user's directory, they will need to
use *DIR to go to that directory first

5. Commander files will be saved into
the individual user's Elite folder
