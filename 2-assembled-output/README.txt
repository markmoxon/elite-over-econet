Acornsoft Elite (Econet version)

Econet conversion by Mark Moxon

For the following networked machines:

* BBC Micro Model B & 16K Sideways RAM
* BBC Micro Model B+ 64K
* BBC Micro Model B+ 128K
* BBC Micro with 6502 Second Processor
* BBC Master 128
* BBC Master Turbo

To install Elite on your network:

1. Create a $.EliteGame directory on
the server and copy all the ELT* files
and this ReadMe file into the directory

2. Create an EliteSaves directory in
the top level of the main directory for
each user who wants to play Elite, and
copy the MAX file into this directory

3. If you want all users to be able to
play Elite, copy all the Elite* files
into $.Library and $.Library1 and
ensure all users have their library set
set accordingly

If you want to restrict it to specific
users, copy all the Elite* files into
the EliteSaves folder that you created
in the users' main directories

4. Users can then play Elite by typing:

*Elite

which will load the correct version of
Elite for their machine.

If you restricted Elite to specific
users, they will need to *DIR into
their own EliteSaves folders first

You can run specific versions using:

*EliteB  (for BBC Micro Elite)
*EliteM  (for BBC Master 128 Elite)
*EliteSP (for 6502 Second Proc Elite)

5. Commander files are saved into each
individual user's EliteSaves folder
