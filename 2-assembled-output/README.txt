Acornsoft Elite (Econet version)

Econet conversion by Mark Moxon

For the following networked machines:

* BBC Micro with 6502 Second Processor
* BBC Master 128
* BBC Master Turbo

To install Elite on your network:

1. Create a directory called $.Elite on
the server and copy all the ELT* files
in there

2. Either copy EliteM and EliteSP into
$.Library and $.Library1 (if you want
all users to be able to play Elite)

Or copy EliteM and EliteSP into each
user's main directory (if you want
to restrict it to those users only)

3. Create a directory called Elite in
each user's main directory, and copy
the MAX file in there

4. Users can then play Elite by typing:

*EliteM  (for BBC Master 128 Elite)

*EliteSP (for 6502 Second Proc Elite)

Commander files will be saved into the
user's Elite folder
