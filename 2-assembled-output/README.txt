Acornsoft Elite (Econet version)

Econet conversion by Mark Moxon

Copy all the EL* files into the
$.LIBRARY directory on the server

Create a directory called ELITE in
the user's main directory, and copy
the MAX file in there

Users can then play Elite by typing:
  *ELITE (for BBC Master 128 Elite)
  *ELITESP (for 6502 Second Proc Elite)

Commander files will be saved into the
user's ELITE folder
