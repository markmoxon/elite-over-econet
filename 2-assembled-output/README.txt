Econet conversion by Mark Moxon

For the following networked machines:

* BBC Micro Model B & 16K Sideways RAM
* BBC Micro Model B+ 64K
* BBC Micro Model B+ 128K
* BBC Micro with 6502 Second Processor
* BBC Master 128

To install Elite on your network:

1. Create a directory called $.Elite on
the server and copy all the ELT* files
and this ReadMe file into the directory

2. If you want all users to be able to
play Elite, copy EliteB, EliteM and
EliteSP into $.Library and $.Library1

If you want to restrict it to specific
users, copy EliteB, EliteM and EliteSP
into just those users' main directories

3. Create a directory called Elite in
the top level of the main directory for
each user who wants to play Elite, and
copy the MAX file there

4. Users can then play Elite by typing:

*EliteB  (for BBC Micro Elite)

*EliteM  (for BBC Master 128 Elite)

*EliteSP (for 6502 Second Proc Elite)

If you restricted Elite to specific
users, they should enter *DIR first

5. Users must have their library set to
$.Library or $.Library1, as appropriate

6. Commander files will be saved into
each individual user's Elite folder
