Archimedes Elite over Econet
by Mark Moxon, Warren Burch and Clive Gringras

This server contains two directories:

* ArcElite contains version 1.14 of Archimedes Elite
from Ian Bell's personal website.

* EliteNet contains the !EliteNet application that
lets Archimedes Elite send scores to a multiplayer
scoreboard over Econet.

For information about Elite, see the !!ReadMe file
and Docs directory in ArcElite.

For information about !EliteNet, click Menu on the
!EliteNet application in the EliteNet directory
display and choose Help from the App submenu.

You may find it quicker to copy the ArcElite and
EliteNet directories to your hard disc and run the
applications from there. They can both be loaded
over Econet, but it is much faster to run them
from local storage.

Right on, Commanders!
