This server contains two directories:

* ArcElite contains version 1.14 of Archimedes Elite
from Ian Bell's personal website.

* EliteNet contains the !EliteNet application that
lets Archimedes Elite send scores to a multiplayer
scoreboard over Econet.

For information about Elite, see the !!ReadMe file
and Docs directory in ArcElite.

For information about !EliteNet, click Menu on the
!EliteNet application in the Finder and choose Help
from the App submenu.

You may find it quicker to copy the ArcElite and
EliteNet directories to your hard disc. They will
both happily load over Econet, but it will be much
faster from local storage.

Right on, Commanders!
