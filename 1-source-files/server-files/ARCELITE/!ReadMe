Archimedes Elite over Econet
by Mark Moxon, Warren Burch and Clive Gringras

This server contains two directories:

* ArcElite contains version 1.14 of Archimedes Elite
from Ian Bell's personal website.

* EliteNet contains the !EliteNet application that
lets Archimedes Elite send scores to a multiplayer
scoreboard over Econet.

For information about Elite, see the !!ReadMe file
and Docs directory in ArcElite.

For information about !EliteNet, click Menu on the
!EliteNet application in the EliteNet directory
display and choose Help from the App submenu.

NOTE: This software is experimental. To minimise
the risk of problems, I recommend you set things
up as follows:

* First, run Elite on its own and set up your
  commander (i.e. load a commander if required,
  and save it under the name you want on the
  scoreboard).

* Click the Elite icon on the icon bar to go
  into the game, click to move past the title
  screen, and click DESK or press F12 to return
  to the Desktop.

* Now you can run !EliteNet, to configure the
  scoreboard and enable transmissions.

* Once transmissions are active, quit !EliteNet
  from the icon bar menu and play Elite as
  normal.

* If you want to change the configuration or
  check the scores, press F12 to return from
  Elite to the Desktop, then load !EliteNet and
  make the changes, and quit !EliteNet when you
  are done.

At this time, the !EliteNet application can
cause Elite to crash, so I recommend quitting
!EliteNet when you ae not using it. The module
that talks to the scoreboard is unaffected by
this, so quitting !EliteNet doesn't affect score
transmission, but it does reduce the likelihood
of a crash.

I am trying to fix this issue, but I'm not there
yet!

You may find it quicker to copy the ArcElite and
EliteNet directories to your hard disc and run the
applications from there. They can both be loaded
over Econet, but it is much faster to run them
from local storage.

Right on, Commanders!
