This repository contains source code for Elite over Econet for the BBC Master 128 and 6502 Second Processor.

This repository contains submodules for each of the individual programs on the disc. Each submodule points to a branch called `econet` that contains the version of that program to be included in the Elite over Econet disc.

The repository also contains the build process for producing the final SSD disc.

See the individual subprojects for more information.
