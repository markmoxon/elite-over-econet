This repository contains source code for Elite over Econet for the BBC Micro, BBC Master 128 and 6502 Second Processor.

Elite over Econet enables you to load Elite over an Acorn network. It also provides multiplayer scoreboard support, so you can run live Elite competitions over the network. For more information, see the [bbcelite.com website](https://www.bbcelite.com/hacks/elite_over_econet.html).

This repository contains submodules for each of the individual programs on the disc. Each submodule points to a branch called `econet` that contains the version of that program to be included in the Elite over Econet disc.

The repository also contains the loader code and build process for producing the final DSD disc. It does this by producing two SSD images, one for each side, and then combining them into a DSD image (as BeebAsm can only create SSD images).

See the individual subprojects for more information.

## Acknowledgements

BBC Micro Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1984.

The code on this site has been reconstructed from a disassembly of the version released on [Ian Bell's personal website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/).

6502 Second Processor Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1985.

The 6502 Second Processor code on this site is identical to the source discs released on [Ian Bell's personal website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/) (it's just been reformatted to be more readable).

BBC Master Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1986.

The BBC Master code on this site has been reconstructed from a disassembly of the version released on [Ian Bell's personal website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/).

The commentary is copyright &copy; Mark Moxon. Any misunderstandings or mistakes in the documentation are entirely my fault.

Huge thanks are due to the original authors for not only creating such an important piece of my childhood, but also for releasing the source code for us to play with; to Paul Brink for his annotated disassembly; and to Kieran Connell for his [BeebAsm version](https://github.com/kieranhj/elite-beebasm), which I forked as the original basis for this project. You can find more information about this project in the [accompanying website's project page](https://www.bbcelite.com/about_site/about_this_project.html).

### A note on licences, copyright etc.

This repository is _not_ provided with a licence, and there is intentionally no `LICENSE` file provided.

According to [GitHub's licensing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository), this means that "the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work".

The reason for this is that the Universe Editor is intertwined with the original Elite source code, and the original source code is copyright. The whole site is therefore covered by default copyright law, to ensure that this copyright is respected.

Under GitHub's rules, you have the right to read and fork this repository... but that's it. No other use is permitted, I'm afraid.

My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available, but the original copyright holders do have the right to ask for it to be taken down, in which case I will comply without hesitation. I do hope, though, that along with the various other disassemblies and commentaries of this source, it will remain viable.

Right on, Commanders!
